# Static Page Generator

## Description

This project uses Python to create a static page generator, basically it turns a Markdown File, in a functional html code.

I have used a lot of functional and object oriented programming on this project, also there is a lot of unit tests in the project. 

### *How to Use*

1 - `git clone https://github.com/marcelodiass/static-generator` 

2 - Add any Markdown files in the content folder, there can only be 1 MD file in the root of content, the other should remain in a folder separately (just as the existing ones as you clone the project.)

3 - Run `./main.sh`

4 - The server with the pages will be running on localhost:8888

5 - Enjoy!
